# My first attempt and practice in web development with React

Run my app with '-npm run start' on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

# `In this project I used techniques like:`
1. Funtion based `Components`
2. Updating screen system using `useState` / `setState`
3. Login emulation using `Context`
4. Routing and navigation between pages with `BrowserRouter` and `useNavigate`
5. And a little bit of `CSS` skills to style it :)
